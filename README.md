## Ruby Application setup boilerplate

This is a setup boilerplate to help you spin up a Ruby application by Flatiron School

---

## Setup (Code Overview)

Before you begin, first run the following command in your terminal to install the dependencies required for this lab:

```sh
bundle install
```

You can now add all of your Ruby files for your models in the `app/models` folder. You **do not** need to require them. They will be automagically require for you so long as you use the `tools/console.rb` file to run your code.

Through this file, we've provided to you a console that you can use to test your code. To enter a console session, run `ruby tools/console.rb` from the command line. You'll be able to test out the methods that you write here. Take a look at that file to see how you can pre-define variables and create object instances, rather than manually doing it in every single console session.
